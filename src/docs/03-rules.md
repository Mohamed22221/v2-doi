## 🧩 Component Development Guidelines

- 🧱 **Keep Components Small**  
  Each component should have a single responsibility to improve readability and reusability.  

  _Example:_  
  Instead of one large form component, split it into `TextInput`, `Checkbox`, and `SubmitButton`.

- 🎨 **Styling Rules**  
  - ❌ Do not use inline styles  
  - ✅ Use Tailwind CSS utility classes only

- ♻️ **Reuse Before Create**  
  Always check existing components before creating new ones.
